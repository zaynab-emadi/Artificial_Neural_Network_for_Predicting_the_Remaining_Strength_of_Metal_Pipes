# ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning Model for Data Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to analyze data and make accurate predictions using advanced statistical and AI techniques.  
The workflow includes:

- **Data Exploration**: Performed data visualization using Box Plot, Correlation Matrix, and Distribution Plots to detect patterns, relationships, and outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and normalized data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical features.
- **Model Training**: Implemented and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predictive analysis.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measured performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and loss curves.
- **Deployment Ready**: The model can be easily integrated into other applications or APIs.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
